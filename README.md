# HoloToolkit
The HoloToolkit is a collection of scripts and components intended to accelerate the development of holographic applications targeting Windows Holographic

---
## Camera
Any scripts or prefabs for the Unity camera.

### Main Camera.prefab
Prefab for the Unity camera with default values set for Holographic rendering.

---
## Common
Any scripts that are referenced from multiple subdirectories within the HoloToolkit.

### Interpolator.cs

A MonoBehaviour that interpolates a transform's position, rotation or scale.

### Singleton.cs
A base class to make a MonoBehaviour follow the singleton design pattern.

---
## Gaze
Any scripts that are based on the user's gaze.

### Billboard.cs
Rotates a hologram so it is always facing towards the camera.

### CursorManager.cs
Control the position and rotation of a cursor that follows the user's gaze.

You must provide GameObjects for the **_CursorOnHologram_** and **_CursorOffHologram_** public fields.

**_CursorOnHologram_** Cursor object to display when you are gazing at a hologram.

**_CursorOffHologram_** Cursor object to display when you are not gazing at a hologram.

**DistanceFromCollision** Distance, in meters, to offset the cursor from a collision with a hologram in the scene.  This is to prevent the cursor from being occluded.

### DirectionIndicator.cs
Show a GameObject around the cursor that points in the direction of the GameObject which this script is attached to.

You must provide GameObjects for the **_Cursor_** and **_DirectionIndicatorObject_** public fields.

**_Cursor_** The object in your scene that is being used as the cursor.  The direction indicator will be rendered around this cursor.

**_DirectionIndicatorObject_** The object that will point in the direction toward the object which this script is attached to.  This object can be a 2D or 3D object.

**DirectionIndicatorColor** The color you want the DirectionIndicatorObject to be.  The material on the DirectionIndicatorObject will need to support the color or TintColor property for this field to work.  Otherwise the DirectionIndicatorObject will continue to render as its exported color.

**TitleSafeFactor** The percentage the GameObject can be within the view frustum for the DirectionIndicatorObject to start appearing.  A value of 0 will display the DirectionIndicatorObject when the GameObject leaves the view.  0.1 will display when the GameObject is 10% away from the edge of the view.  -0.1 will display when the GameObject is 10% out of view.

### FixedAngularSize.cs
Causes a hologram to maintain a fixed angular size, which is to say it occupies the same pixels in the view regardless of its distance from the camera.

### GazeManager.cs
Perform raycasts in the user's gaze direction to get the position and normals of any collisions.

**MaxGazeDistance** The maximum distance to raycast.  Any holograms beyond this value will not be raycasted to.

**RaycastLayerMask** The Unity layers to raycast against.  If you have holograms that should not be raycasted against, like a cursor, do not include their layers in this mask.

### GazeStabilizer.cs
Stabilize the user's gaze to account for head jitter.

**StoredStabilitySamples** Number of samples that you want to iterate on.  A larger number will be more stable.

**PositionDropOffRadius** Position based distance away from gravity well.

**DirectionDropOffRadius** Direction based distance away from gravity well.

**PositionStrength** Position lerp interpolation factor.

**DirectionStrength** Direction lerp interpolation factor.

**StabilityAverageDistanceWeight** Stability average weight multiplier factor.

**StabilityVarianceWeight** Stability variance weight multiplier factor.

### HandGuidance.cs
Show a GameObject when a gesturing hand is about to lose tracking.

You must provide GameObjects for the **_Cursor_** and **_HandGuidanceIndicator_** public fields.

**_Cursor_** The object in your scene that is being used as the cursor.  The hand guidance indicator will be rendered around this cursor.

**_HandGuidanceIndicator_** GameObject to display when your hand is about to lose tracking.

**HandGuidanceThreshold** When to start showing the HandGuidanceIndicator.  1 is out of view, 0 is centered in view.

### SimpleTagalong.cs
A Tagalong that stays at a fixed distance from the camera and always seeks to have a part of itself in the view frustum of the camera.

### Tagalong.cs
A Tagalong that extends SimpleTagalong that allows for specifying the minimum and target percentage of the object to keep in the view frustum of the camera and that keeps the Tagalong object in front of other holograms including the Spatial Mapping Mesh.
